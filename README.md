### Employee Attrition Analysis in Tech Companies

In this project, I perform an analysis of various factors contributing to employee attrition in technology companies. The analysis examines the individual impact of each factor as well as the relationships between them. Following this, I apply traditional machine learning techniques to build a model capable of predicting employee attrition with high accuracy. 

The project is based on a dataset available on Kaggle: [HR Employee Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itssuru/hr-employee-attrition).
